# LA Burglary Pattern Analysis

This project explores patterns and trends in burglary-related crimes in Los Angeles using public crime data. The goal was to apply exploratory data analysis, visual storytelling, and classification models to support potential policy and policing insights.

## Key Objectives

- Clean and prepare LAPD crime data with a focus on burglary.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualise spatial, temporal, and categorical crime patterns.
- Build and evaluate predictive models to classify whether a burglary leads to an arrest.
- Interpret model behaviour using SHAP values and feature importance.

## Features

- Classification using Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM.
- Model performance evaluation via ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and accuracy.
- Data visualisations including heatmaps, bar charts, and time-series plots.
- SHAP analysis for explainability.

## Files Included

- `LA_Burglary_Pattern_Analysis.ipynb`: Cleaned analysis notebook.
- `LA_Burglary_Pattern_Analysis.pdf`: Report with visuals and insights.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License.

## Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
