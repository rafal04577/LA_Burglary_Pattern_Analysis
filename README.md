# LA Burglary Pattern Analysis (2020–2024)

This project explores burglary-related crime patterns in Los Angeles using data from 2020 to early 2024. It combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, geospatial visualisation, and machine learning to generate insights that can assist law enforcement in resource allocation and crime prevention.
